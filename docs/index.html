<p>Welcome to the Tynted-Engine wiki!</p>

<p>There is much for you to learn whether through the API, Docs, or even the examples. I hope you find what you are looking for!</p>

<p>You can find what you need on the side bar. The API is a functional documentation intended as a reference to the programmatic implementation of the explanations demonstrated in the Docs. The docs are useful for knowledge reading and understanding the inner workings of Tynted Engine, and how you can use it to create your game. The Examples can be helpful in understanding practical uses of the engine.</p>

<p>Feel free to look around and find what you need. The docs are intended to go in a natural order to understand the topics at hand, but you of course can use it as a quick reference guide.</p>

<p>You can start off by following this guide on creating a new project: <a href="https://github.com/rogersteve97/Tynted-Engine/wiki/Setting-Up">Setting Up</a></p>
