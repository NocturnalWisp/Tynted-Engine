Tynted Engine was created to develop a game engine using the Entity Component System pattern. Other patterns like the observer pattern help to keep each core of the engine independent. 

There is a wiki for Tynted Engine which will help you to get started creating games in the engine. You can find out the API, how to compile, ECS theory, creating a game, and creating extensions for the engine.

The engine offers extensions which help developers to work more iteratively and faster using module-based entities, components, and systems.
