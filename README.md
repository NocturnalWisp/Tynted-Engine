Tynted Engine was created so I could test out the Entity Component System design pattern for the first time. Other patterns like the observer pattern help to keep each part of the engine non-dependant upon the other parts. 

There is a wiki for Tynted Engine which will help you to get started creating games in the engine.

Best of luck to you! and I hope you find this engine helpful.
